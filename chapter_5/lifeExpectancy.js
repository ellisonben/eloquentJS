/*
When we looked up all the people in our data set that lived more than 90 years, 
only the latest generation in the data came out. Letâ€™s take a closer look at 
that phenomenon.

Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry data set per 
century. A person is assigned to a century by taking their year of death, 
dividing it by 100, and rounding it up, as in Math.ceil(person.died / 100).

For bonus points, write a function groupBy that abstracts the grouping 
operation. It should accept as arguments an array and a function that computes 
the group for an element in the array and returns an object that maps group 
names to arrays of group members.
